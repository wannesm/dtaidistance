Welcome to DTAIDistance's documentation!
========================================

Library for time series distances (e.g. Dynamic Time Warping) used in
the `DTAI Research Group <https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be>`__. The library
offers a pure Python implementation and a faster implementation in C.
The C implementation has only Cython as a dependency. It is compatible
with Numpy and Pandas and implemented to avoid unnecessary data copy
operations
